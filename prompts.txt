Create a 3D text effect in Arabic that looks like it is made out of real bread rolls (fino bread). Each letter should be realistically shaped using golden-brown soft bread rolls, with fluffy textures and slightly crispy crusts. Add some small bread pieces or crumbs around the text for decoration. The design should be ultra-realistic, with clean lighting on a white background, making the word appear as if sculpted from fresh bakery bread.
